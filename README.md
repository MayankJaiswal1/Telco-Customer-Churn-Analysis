## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a corporate-grade Telco Churn Analysis & Retention System, designed for business or data analyst roles.

**Objective:** Identify, quantify, and mitigate churn risk by analyzing subscriber behavior, predicting churn probability, and enabling targeted retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Telecom operators face high churn rates due to:
* Easy mobile number portability
* Aggressive low-cost competitors
* Unsatisfied or disengaged customers

**Key insight:** Retaining existing customers is 5–10x more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

**The goal:** not just predict churn, but understand "why" and "what" to act upon.

## 🔍 Churn Categories

1. **Tariff Plan Churn:** Downgrading from high-value plans → revenue loss
2. **Service Churn:** Dropping specific services (e.g., mobile data)
3. **Product Churn:** Switching from postpaid → prepaid accounts
4. **Usage Churn:** Gradual inactivity

---

## 👥 Subscriber Segmentation

* **Loyal:** Inert, Unconditionally Loyal, Locked-in
* **Risky:** Conditionally Loyal, Unsatisfied Churners
* **Non-Loyal:** Lifestyle Migrators, Conditional Churners

---

## 🧰 Data Collection & Preparation

* Collected customer profiles, billing/usage, and service query data
* Transformed unstructured data into structured formats for analysis
* Cleaned and normalized datasets for predictive modeling and dashboarding

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Predictive Modeling

* Performed EDA in Power BI to visualize churn patterns
* **Example insight:** Customers with <20 months tenure have 17.76% churn probability
* Integrated ML-based Churn Index Score to calculate individual risk probabilities
* Segmented population into Low, Risky, High Risky cohorts

---

## 🎛 Power BI Dashboard Structure

1. **🏠 Home Page:** Central navigation hub
2. **📈 Summary Report:** Compare total population vs. churners
3. **🧾 Customer Details:** Select customer ID → view personal info + churn index + risk level
4. **💡 Churn Reasons:** Visualize high-risk population and revenue at stake
5. **❓ Ask a Question:** Natural language AI queries to discover trends

---

## 💡 Retention & Recommendations

* Target interventions based on churn type and risk
* **Example:** Unsatisfied churners → personalized offers to recover revenue
* Strategy enables proactive retention, turning reactive troubleshooting into data-driven action

---

## 📈 Key Business Impact

* Analyzed **100K+ subscribers** to quantify churn risk
* Calculated **Churn Index Score** for all customers
* Identified **2.42M high-risk customers** contributing to revenue at stake
* Enabled data-driven retention strategies with measurable ROI
